<!-- Grass Blade - Single blade for top-down 2D game view
     Designed to match the programmatic blade in GrassScene.cpp
     Base dimensions: 2px wide x 12px tall
     Origin at bottom-left corner of blade base
     Blade tapers to a point at the top with curved edges

  <!--
    The blade is defined as a closed path using cubic Bezier curves.
    Starting at the left base (0,0), curving up to the tip, then back down the right side.

    Coordinate system:
    - Y axis points UP (negative Y values go toward tip)
    - Origin at bottom-left of blade base

    Path breakdown:
    - M 0,0 : Start at left base
    - C -2,-4 -0.5,-10 1,-12 : Left edge curve (outward bow, then in to tip)
    - C 2.5,-10 4,-4 2,0 : Right edge curve (out from tip, then back to base)
    - Z : Close path back to start
