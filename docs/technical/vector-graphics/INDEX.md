# Vector Graphics System - Technical Documentation

Created: 2025-10-24
Status: Research & Documentation Phase

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive technical documentation for the vector graphics rendering system in world-sim. The game uses vector-based assets (SVG) with real-time rendering, procedural variation, and dynamic animation capabilities.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Desktop-first**: Targeting OpenGL 3.3+ (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- **Performance-driven**: 60 FPS with 10,000+ animated entities
- **Hybrid approach**: Multiple rendering tiers for different use cases
- **Animation-focused**: Real-time spline deformation for organic movement
- **No premature commitments**: Analyze multiple options before choosing libraries

## System Architecture

The vector graphics system uses a **four-tier rendering architecture**:

1. **Tier 1 - Static Backgrounds**: Pre-rasterized tile textures, cached in GPU atlases
2. **Tier 2 - Semi-Static Structures**: CPU-tessellated meshes, cached and reused
3. **Tier 3 - Dynamic Animated Entities**: Real-time tessellation with batched GPU rendering
4. **Tier 4 - GPU Compute (Future)**: Advanced effects using compute shaders

See [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for complete system design.

## Game Requirements Context

### Visual Requirements
- **Layered rendering**: Static tile backgrounds + dynamic vector entities on top
- **Real-time deformation**: Grass bending as entities walk through, trees swaying in wind
- **Procedural variation**: Each tile instance varies (color, rotation, scale)
- **Interactivity**: Grass harvestable by animals, visual feedback for trampling

### Performance Requirements
- **Frame rate**: 60 FPS target
- **Entity count**: 10,000+ concurrent animated objects
- **Tessellation budget**: <2ms CPU time per frame
- **Draw call budget**: <100 calls per frame
- **Memory budget**: ~350 MB total for vector rendering

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform**: Desktop only (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- **Graphics API**: OpenGL 3.3+ / OpenGL ES 3.0
- **Architecture**: Client/server with ECS on both sides
- **Asset format**: SVG with custom metadata

## Quick Reference

### Common Use Cases

**Adding a new static tile background:**
1. Create SVG asset
2. Pre-rasterize at multiple LOD levels (Tier 1)
3. Add to texture atlas
4. Reference in tile definition

**Adding an animated entity (grass, tree):**
1. Create SVG with animation metadata (spline keyframes)
2. Define collision shape (usually simplified)
3. Implement animation update logic (Tier 3)
4. Add to batch renderer

**Creating a complex structure:**
1. Create SVG asset
2. Tessellate once at load time (Tier 2)
3. Cache mesh in GPU memory
4. Render with transform-only updates
