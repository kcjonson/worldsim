## Description

The UI should blend futuristic/sci-fi elements with a rugged, frontier aesthetic. Think space western - advanced technology with a worn, practical feel.

Key characteristics:
- Clean, readable interfaces with a technical feel
- Earth tones and muted colors
- Weathered/distressed textures
- Functional, utilitarian design
- Balance between high-tech displays and rustic elements
