## Recent Decisions

### Documentation & Organization
- 2025-10-12 - Tech docs instead of ADRs, no numbering (topic-based organization)
- 2025-10-12 - Created workflows.md for common tasks (separate from CLAUDE.md)
- 2025-10-12 - CLAUDE.md streamlined to ~124 lines (was 312) - navigation guide only

### C++ Standards & Tools
- 2025-10-12 - **Naming**: PascalCase for classes/functions, camelCase for variables, m_ prefix for members, k prefix for constants
- 2025-10-12 - **Header guards**: `#pragma once` (not traditional guards)
- 2025-10-12 - **File organization**: Headers (.h) and implementation (.cpp) side-by-side in same directory
- 2025-10-12 - **Linting**: clang-format (manual formatting) + clang-tidy (automatic analysis)
- 2025-10-12 - Using user's existing .clang-format config (tabs, 140 column limit)

### Architecture Decisions
- 2025-10-12 - **Vector-based assets (SVG)**: All game assets use SVG format with dynamic rasterization
- 2025-10-12 - Using nested library structure with clear dependency hierarchy (6 core libraries)
- 2025-10-12 - Using "scenes" terminology (game dev standard), not "screens"
- 2025-10-12 - UI testability as a core requirement with inspector system
- 2025-10-12 - **Custom ECS** implementation in engine (not external library like EnTT)
- 2025-10-12 - **Roll our own implementations** for core systems (no external libs except platform/format support)
- 2025-10-24 - **Client/Server Architecture from Day One**: Two-process design (world-sim + world-sim-server) even for single-player
- 2025-10-24 - **Server spawns on-demand**: Only starts when player begins/loads game, not during main menu
- 2025-10-24 - **HTTP + WebSocket protocol**: HTTP for control plane (create/load game), WebSocket for real-time gameplay (60 Hz)
- 2025-10-24 - **HTTP Debug Server**: Separate debugging system (port 8080) using Server-Sent Events for real-time metrics
- 2025-10-24 - **World object taxonomy**: Terrain (base), Flora (vegetation), Structures (buildings/ruins), Entities (dynamic)
- 2025-10-24 - **Batch updates for mass events**: Area mutations (plagues, fires) use efficient batch messaging instead of individual events
- 2025-10-24 - **cpp-httplib** for networking: Header-only library for both game server and debug server
- 2025-10-26 - **Procedural Tile Rendering**: Tiles are code-generated (not SVG-based), with procedural ground covers (grass, sand, rock, water, etc.)
- 2025-10-26 - **Biome Influence Percentage System**: Tiles have multiple biome influences (e.g., `{ meadow: 80%, forest: 20% }`), creating natural ecotones hundreds of tiles deep
- 2025-10-26 - **SVG Asset Categorization**: Three distinct uses: (1) Decorations/Entities (placed objects like flowers, trees), (2) Texture Patterns (fills for code-drawn shapes like brick walls), (3) Animated Vegetation (spline deformation)
- 2025-10-26 - **Deterministic Procedural Variation**: Same world position always generates same appearance (seed-based), ensuring consistency and multiplayer compatibility
- 2025-10-26 - **Ground Covers vs Biomes**: Ground covers are physical surface types (permanent), biomes determine which covers appear and spawn decorations
- 2025-10-26 - **Seasonal Overlays**: Snow is not a ground cover but a seasonal overlay system (0-100% coverage on top of existing ground)
- 2025-10-26 - **1:1 Pixel Mapping for UI**: Primitive rendering uses framebuffer dimensions for pixel-perfect rendering - `Rect(50, 50, 200, 100)` is always exactly 200×100 pixels, matching RmlUI/ImGui industry standards
- 2025-10-26 - **Logging Macro Naming**: Use unprefixed global macros (`LOG_ERROR` not `WSIM_LOG_ERROR`) for brevity and developer experience, accepting potential library conflict risk
- 2025-10-27 - **Client-Side History Aggregation (Developer Client)**: Server streams current values only (stateless), client maintains all history with configurable retention (metrics: time-based, logs: count-based), localStorage persistence with automatic cleanup

## Architecture Decision: Singletons vs DI

**Decision**: Keep singletons for rendering (industry best practice for game engines)

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Singletons = zero indirection, one static pointer dereference
- **Industry Standard**: Unreal, Unity, id Tech all use singletons for core systems
- **Cache Friendly**: Fixed memory location, better CPU prediction
- **No Parameter Overhead**: Don't need to pass renderer to every function
- **Best Practice**: Core systems (Renderer, Audio, Physics, Input) use singletons
- **Flexibility Where Needed**: Gameplay systems can use DI or ECS patterns

Colonysim's singleton architecture is correct for game engine performance.

## Architecture Decision: Rendering Integration Strategy

**Decision**: TBD after PR 1 compatibility analysis

**Option A (Recommended)**: Adopt VectorGraphics
- Use colonysim's VectorGraphics as implementation behind worldsim's Primitives API
- Get mature batching + text rendering + scissor support
- Keep worldsim's clean API (scenes already use it)
- Minimal refactoring of existing worldsim code

**Option B**: Adapt to Primitives API
- Keep worldsim's BatchRenderer
- Port colonysim code to call Primitives API
- More work, but keeps worldsim's architecture pure

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Coordinate system compatibility
- State management complexity
- Performance characteristics
- Code maintainability

## Development Log

### 2025-10-29 - PR 2: Font Rendering System ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation Complete:**

Successfully ported colonysim's FreeType-based font rendering system to worldsim.

**Files Created:**
- `libs/renderer/shader/shader.h` + `.cpp` - Shader utility class (loads from files)
- `libs/ui/font/font_renderer.h` + `.cpp` - Font rendering system (~350 lines)
- `shaders/text.vert` + `text.frag` - Text rendering shaders
- `apps/ui-sandbox/scenes/font_test_scene.cpp` - Demo scene
- `fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf` - Font file

**Files Modified:**
- `vcpkg.json` - Added FreeType dependency
- `libs/renderer/CMakeLists.txt` - Added shader source
- `libs/ui/CMakeLists.txt` - Added font_renderer + FreeType linkage
- `apps/ui-sandbox/CMakeLists.txt` - Added font_test_scene
- `libs/renderer/primitives/batch_renderer.h/.cpp` - Added GetViewport() method
- `libs/renderer/primitives/primitives.h/.cpp` - Exposed GetViewport() API
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added critical workflow for testing visual changes

**Technical Details:**
- Ported from colonysim with C++20 designated initializers
- Changed glad → GLEW (worldsim standard)
- Added GetViewport() API to query actual window dimensions
- Fixed projection matrix to use runtime viewport (not hardcoded 800x600)
- Font shaders compile to texture atlas for ASCII 0-128
- Text measurement + max glyph height utilities included

**Demo Scene:**
- Renders "Hello World!" at various scales (0.8x, 1.0x, 1.2x, 1.5x, 2.0x)
- Multiple colored text samples (red, green, blue, orange, white)
- Correctly handles actual viewport dimensions (5120x2880 on test machine)

**Lessons Learned:**
- CRITICAL: Must kill old instance → rebuild → launch new instance to test changes
- Port conflicts show helpful error message with curl command to exit
- Projection matrix must match actual framebuffer dimensions from GetViewport()
- Added explicit workflow to CLAUDE.md to prevent future mistakes

**Next:**
PR 3: Style System

### 2025-10-29 - Colonysim UI Integration - Comprehensive Analysis & Planning

**Strategic Planning Session:**

Conducted comprehensive analysis of `/Volumes/Code/colonysim` codebase to identify valuable UI systems for integration into worldsim. Created detailed 9-PR implementation plan with clear dependencies and deliverables.

**Colonysim Codebase Analysis:**

Analyzed 284 source files across colonysim project to identify production-quality C++20 UI systems:

**Systems Identified (by quality and value):**

1. **Font Rendering System** (9/10 quality, ~350 lines)
   - FreeType-based glyph caching (ASCII 0-128)
   - Pre-rendered textures per character
   - Text measurement and layout utilities
   - Dedicated vertex/fragment shaders
   - **Highly portable** - only depends on FreeType and Shader class

2. **Layer/Container Hierarchy** (9.5/10 quality, ~350 lines)
   - Parent-child scene graph with z-index ordering
   - Dirty flag optimization (only sorts when needed)
   - WorldSpace vs ScreenSpace projection types
   - Update/input propagation through tree
   - **Comprehensive documentation** (LayeringSystem.md)

3. **Style System** (9/10 quality, ~200 lines)
   - Composition-based (Base + Border classes)
   - Modern C++ with designated initializers
   - Concrete styles: Rectangle, Circle, Line, Text, Polygon
   - **Clean data structures**, highly portable

4. **Shape System** (8.5/10 quality, ~400 lines)
   - All shapes extend Layer (uniform treatment)
   - Rectangle, Circle, Line, Polygon, Text implementations
   - Dirty flag pattern for optimization
   - **Key insight**: Everything is a Layer!

5. **UI Components** (8.5/10 quality, ~1,400 lines)
   - **Button**: State machine (normal/hover/pressed), callbacks, type-based styling
   - **TextInput**: Focus management, cursor + blinking, scrolling, placeholder
   - **Feature-complete** but needs input abstraction (direct GLFW calls)

6. **VectorGraphics Batching** (9/10 quality, ~300 lines)
   - Batched rendering singleton
   - Queues geometry + text separately
   - Scissor support for clipping
   - **Mature implementation**, proven in production

7. **CoordinateSystem** (9/10 quality, ~100 lines)
   - Multi-DPI support with pixel ratio
   - Screen/world space conversions
   - Percentage-based layout helpers

**Worldsim Current State Analysis:**

Compared against worldsim's rendering architecture:

**Worldsim Strengths:**
- Clean Primitives API with batching
- Memory arenas (14x faster than malloc)
- Resource handle system with generation tracking
- Debug server with real-time metrics streaming
- Simple but effective scene management

**Worldsim Gaps:**
- No text rendering
- No texture system
- No UI hierarchy (scenes only)
- Incomplete state management (scissor/transform tracked but not applied)
- No Bezier curve support (blocks Phase 4+ vector graphics validation)

**Architectural Decisions:**

**1. Singleton Architecture Decision:**
- **Keep singletons for rendering** (industry best practice)
- Performance: Zero indirection, cache-friendly, no parameter overhead
- Industry standard: Unreal, Unity, id Tech all use singletons for core systems
- Colonysim's architecture is correct for game engine performance

**2. Rendering Integration Strategy:**
- **Decision deferred** to PR 1 compatibility analysis
- **Option A (Recommended)**: Adopt colonysim's VectorGraphics as implementation behind worldsim's Primitives API
  - Get mature batching + text + scissor support
  - Keep worldsim's clean API (scenes already use it)
  - Minimal refactoring
- **Option B**: Keep worldsim's BatchRenderer, port colonysim code to use Primitives API

**Key Insights:**

**Production-Ready Code**: Colonysim's UI systems are 8.5-9.5/10 quality with modern C++20 patterns, proper optimizations, and comprehensive features.

**Architectural Compatibility**: Both projects use singletons, GLFW, OpenGL 3.3+, similar patterns. High compatibility expected.

**Hybrid Approach Best**: Use colonysim's VectorGraphics as implementation layer behind worldsim's Primitives API. Best of both worlds.

**Minimal Refactoring**: Keep worldsim's scene system and API, swap implementation underneath. Existing scenes continue working.

**Performance Focus**: All architectural decisions prioritize performance over flexibility (singletons, batching, dirty flags, memory arenas).

**Files Updated:**
- `/docs/status.md` - Added colonysim integration plan with 9 PRs, architectural decisions, task breakdown

**Next Session:**
Start PR 1 (Compatibility Analysis) - verify coordinate systems, test minimal integration, make rendering strategy decision.

### 2025-10-29 - Vector Graphics Validation Plan - Grass Blade Phases

**Documentation Update - Progressive Complexity Validation:**

Updated the vector graphics validation plan to reflect completed star phases and add new grass blade phases that introduce Bezier curve tessellation.

**Validation Progression:**

**Phase 0-3: Stars (COMPLETE) ✅**
- Validated basic polygon tessellation with straight line segments
- Proven 60 FPS with 10,000 static and animated stars
- Batching system works effectively (<100 draw calls)
- Foundation for vector graphics rendering established

**Phase 4-7: Grass Blades (IN PROGRESS) 🔄**
- **Phase 4**: Single grass blade with Bezier curves (introduces curve flattening)
- **Phase 5**: 10,000 static grass blades (batching with curved shapes)
- **Phase 6**: 10,000 animated grass blades (swaying/bending - CRITICAL validation)
- **Phase 7**: SVG loading with curve support

**Why Grass Blades Next:**
- **More complex than stars**: Requires Bezier curve tessellation, not just straight edges
- **Actual game assets**: Grass tufts are ground decorations in the design docs
- **Animation critical**: Grass swaying, bending, trampling are key gameplay features
- **Representative shapes**: Organic curved vegetation (not geometric stars)
- **Performance validation**: Curves create 2-3x more triangles than simple polygons

**Key Design Decisions:**

**Progressive validation approach**: Simple shapes first (stars) prove basic tessellation, then curved shapes (grass) prove the complete system can handle production assets.

**Performance budget adjustments**: Grass blades have slightly higher budgets (3ms tessellation vs 2ms, 8ms GPU vs 6ms) due to increased triangle count from curves.

**Critical validation milestone**: Phase 6 (10k animated grass blades) is the final proof that organic vector graphics with real-time curve-based animation is viable at production scale.

**Documentation Updated:**
- `/docs/technical/vector-graphics/validation-plan.md` - Added phases 4-7 for grass blades
- `/docs/status.md` - Updated active tasks and next steps

**Timeline:**
- Stars: ~1 week ✅ COMPLETE
- Grass: ~1 week ⏳ IN PROGRESS (starting Phase 4)
- Overall: ~2 weeks to prove full vector graphics viability

### 2025-10-29 - Sandbox Control Endpoints Implementation

**Production Developer Tools Enhancement:**

Implemented HTTP control endpoints for the ui-sandbox, enabling remote control via simple GET requests with query parameters. Completes the sandbox development workflow with graceful lifecycle management and port conflict detection.

**Implementation:**

1. **ControlAction Enum** - Single atomic enum prevents conflicting control directives
   - Actions: `None`, `Exit`, `SceneChange`, `Pause`, `Resume`, `ReloadScene`
   - Thread-safe atomic operations (HTTP thread writes, main thread reads)

2. **Control Endpoint** - `GET /api/control?action={action}`
   - `?action=exit` - Gracefully exit sandbox
   - `?action=scene&scene=name` - Switch scenes with validation
   - `?action=pause` - Pause scene updates/rendering
   - `?action=resume` - Resume scene updates/rendering
   - `?action=reload` - Reload current scene (OnExit + OnEnter)
   - Returns JSON responses with status/error

3. **Main Loop Integration**
   - Control action checking after `glfwPollEvents()`
   - All actions execute on main thread (GLFW/OpenGL safety)
   - Scene switching with validation and logging
   - Pause state tracking (skips update/render when paused)

4. **Port Conflict Detection**
   - Disabled SO_REUSEADDR on server socket
   - Prevents multiple instances on same port
   - Clear error message with curl command to kill existing instance
   - Instant detection (no HTTP connection delay)

5. **Scene Manager Enhancement**
   - Added `GetCurrentSceneName()` method for reload functionality

**Design Decisions:**

**Single atomic enum over multiple flags:** Prevents conflicting directives. Simpler API with clear semantics.

**GET with query params over POST+JSON:** Simpler for future use. Browser-testable. No JSON parsing.

**Disabled SO_REUSEADDR:** Prevents port conflicts without separate socket check. Fast and reliable.

**Main thread execution:** All GLFW/OpenGL operations on main thread. HTTP thread only sets flags.

**Files Modified:**
- `libs/foundation/debug/debug_server.{h,cpp}` - Control endpoint, SO_REUSEADDR disable
- `libs/engine/scene/scene_manager.{h,cpp}` - Added GetCurrentSceneName()
- `apps/ui-sandbox/main.cpp` - Control action processing in main loop
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added Sandbox Control section

**Testing:**
- ✅ Pause/Resume - verified scene updates stop/start
- ✅ Scene switching - tested shapes → arena transition
- ✅ Scene reload - verified OnExit/OnEnter called
- ✅ Exit - clean shutdown with exit code 0
- ✅ Port conflict - second instance fails with helpful error

### 2025-10-27 - Resource Handle System Implementation

**Foundational Engine Pattern Complete:**

Implemented a production-ready resource handle system for safe asset management. Handles provide safe references to resources (textures, meshes, SVG assets) with automatic stale reference detection via generation counters.

**Implementation:**

Created header-only handle system in `libs/renderer/resources/` with two components:

1. **ResourceHandle** (`resource_handle.h`) - Core 32-bit handle type
   - 16-bit index (lower bits) + 16-bit generation (upper bits)
   - Packing/unpacking methods: `GetIndex()`, `GetGeneration()`
   - Factory methods: `Make()`, `Invalid()`
   - Comparison operators for equality checks
   - Type-safe aliases: `TextureHandle`, `MeshHandle`, `SVGAssetHandle`

2. **ResourceManager<T>** (`resource_manager.h`) - Generic template manager
   - Free list for index recycling (O(1) allocation/deallocation)
   - Generation tracking prevents stale handle access
   - `Allocate()` - Get new handle, reuses freed slots
   - `Free()` - Increment generation, add to free list
   - `Get()` - Retrieve resource with validation
   - Capacity: 65,536 resources max per type (16-bit index)

**Key Features:**
- Header-only (no build system changes needed)
- Generation validation (detects stale/dangling references)
- O(1) allocation, free, and lookup
- Compact (4 bytes vs 8-byte pointer)
- Serializable (save/load as 32-bit value)
- Type-safe via templates

**Testing:**

Created comprehensive test suite in `apps/ui-sandbox/demos/handle_demo.cpp`:

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Basic Allocation: Allocate 3 handles, set/get data correctly
- ✅ Free List Reuse: Freed indices 1,2,3 → reallocated as 3,2 (LIFO, gen incremented)
- ✅ Stale Handle Detection: Old handle returns null after free/realloc
- ✅ Handle Validation: Invalid handles, out-of-range indices handled safely
- ✅ Comparison Operators: Equality/inequality work correctly

**Use Cases:**
- Texture management with hot-reloading
- SVG asset caching
- Mesh resource pooling
- Any resource with potential lifetime issues

**Design Decisions:**

**Generation prevents stale access:** When resource freed, generation increments. Old handles with old generation return null on Get().

**Free list LIFO order:** Reuses most recently freed slot first. Improves cache locality for resources with similar lifetimes.

**Not thread-safe:** Each thread should use separate manager instance or add external synchronization. Documented as constraint.

**65,536 resource limit:** 16-bit index allows up to 65,536 resources per type. Can increase index bits if needed, trading generation bits.

**Files Created:**
- `libs/renderer/resources/resource_handle.h` - Handle type (75 lines, header-only)
- `libs/renderer/resources/resource_manager.h` - Manager template (115 lines, header-only)
- `apps/ui-sandbox/demos/handle_demo.cpp` - Test suite (270 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/ui-sandbox/CMakeLists.txt` - Use handle_demo for testing

**Integration:**
- All tests run automatically on ui-sandbox startup
- Console output shows detailed validation results
- No build system changes needed (header-only)

**Benefits:**
- Prevents dangling pointer bugs
- Enables hot-reloading (reload asset, handle stays valid)
- Half the memory of raw pointers (4 vs 8 bytes)
- Serialization-friendly for save files

**Next Steps:**
Vector graphics system can now use handles for SVG assets and rasterized texture caching.

### 2025-10-27 - Memory Arena Allocators Implementation

**Foundational Engine Pattern Complete:**

Implemented a production-ready memory arena allocator system for fast temporary allocations. Arenas provide 10-100× faster allocation/deallocation compared to standard malloc/new by using simple pointer-bump allocation and bulk deallocation.

**Implementation:**

Created header-only arena system in `libs/foundation/memory/arena.h` with three classes:

1. **Arena** - Core linear allocator
   - Allocates large buffer once via `malloc()`
   - Bump-pointer allocation with alignment support
   - Type-safe templated methods: `Allocate<T>()`, `AllocateArray<T>(count)`
   - Instant reset via pointer reset (no per-object cleanup)
   - Capacity tracking: `GetUsed()`, `GetSize()`, `GetRemaining()`

2. **FrameArena** - Per-frame wrapper
   - Designed for per-frame temporary data
   - `ResetFrame()` method for end-of-frame cleanup
   - Same allocation interface as Arena

3. **ScopedArena** - RAII wrapper
   - Saves checkpoint on construction
   - Automatically resets arena on destruction
   - For scoped temporary allocations

**Key Features:**
- Header-only (no build system changes needed)
- Non-copyable (deleted copy constructor/assignment)
- Alignment-aware (respects `alignof(T)` for all types)
- Debug-friendly (`assert()` on out-of-memory)
- ~170 lines total

**Performance Testing:**

Created comprehensive test suite in `apps/ui-sandbox/demos/arena_demo.cpp`:

**Performance Test Results:**
- Arena: 70 microseconds for 10,000 Vec2 allocations
- Standard: 652μs allocation + 342μs deallocation = 994μs total
- **Speedup: 14.2× faster than standard allocation**
- Reset: Instant (< 1 microsecond for any size)

**Validation Tests:**
- ✅ Alignment Test: All alignments correct (1, 4, 8, 16-byte)
- ✅ Capacity Test: Correctly tracked 800 bytes for 100 uint64_t allocations
- ✅ Reset Test: Instant reset to 0 bytes used
- ✅ Scoped Test: RAII automatic reset on scope exit (80 bytes → 0 bytes)

**Use Cases:**
- Per-frame temporary data (UI layout, debug rendering)
- Chunk generation scratch space (noise buffers, tile processing)
- Vector graphics tessellation (upcoming)
- Algorithm temporary buffers
- String building and formatting

**Design Decisions:**

**Does NOT call destructors:** Arenas are for POD types or manual cleanup. Documented as a constraint.

**Not thread-safe:** Each thread should use its own arena. Documented as a constraint.

**Assert on out-of-memory:** Fail-fast in debug builds instead of graceful degradation. Forces proper arena sizing during development.

**Files Created:**
- `libs/foundation/memory/arena.h` - Complete implementation (170 lines, header-only)
- `apps/ui-sandbox/demos/arena_demo.cpp` - Comprehensive test suite (208 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/ui-sandbox/CMakeLists.txt` - Switched from shapes_demo to arena_demo for testing

**Integration:**
- All tests run automatically on ui-sandbox startup
- Console output shows performance comparison and test results
- No build system changes needed (header-only)

**Next Engine Pattern:**
Resource handles (32-bit IDs with generation counter) for safe asset management.

### 2025-10-27 - Logging System Bug Fix - Developer Client Integration

**Critical Bug Fixed:**

Discovered and fixed two bugs preventing DEBUG logs from appearing in the developer client browser UI.

**Bug #1: Pre-Filtering Issue**

**Problem:** Logger was filtering logs by level BEFORE sending to debug server. This meant DEBUG logs (and any filtered logs) never reached the developer client, even though the client has its own filtering UI.

**Root Cause:** In `Logger::Log()` (`libs/foundation/utils/log.cpp`), the level filter check happened before calling `debugServer->UpdateLog()`:
```cpp
// OLD CODE (WRONG):
if (level < GetLevel(category)) {
    return;  // Too verbose, skip - NEVER REACHES DEBUG SERVER!
}
// ... format message ...
if (s_debugServer) {
    s_debugServer->UpdateLog(...);  // DEBUG logs never get here
}
```

**Fix:** Reordered code to send ALL logs to debug server before applying console filtering:
```cpp
// NEW CODE (CORRECT):
// Format message first
char message[256];
vsnprintf(message, sizeof(message), format, args);

// Send to debug server (ALL logs, regardless of console filter)
if (s_debugServer) {
    s_debugServer->UpdateLog(...);
}

// THEN apply level filter for console output
if (level < GetLevel(category)) {
    return;  // Skip console, but already sent to debug server
}
```

**Result:** Developer client receives ALL logs, users can filter in browser UI. Console still respects level filters (less noise).

**Bug #2: Race Condition on Startup**

**Problem:** Debug server was initialized AFTER most startup logs fired, so early logs never reached the ring buffer (`s_debugServer` was nullptr).

**Fix:** Moved debug server initialization to very beginning of `main()`:
```cpp
int main() {
    // Parse args FIRST (no logging yet)
    // ...

    Logger::Initialize();

    // Start debug server IMMEDIATELY (before any logs)
    Foundation::DebugServer debugServer;
    foundation::Logger::SetDebugServer(&debugServer);
    debugServer.Start(8081);

    // NOW all logs go to ring buffer
    LOG_INFO(UI, "UI Sandbox - Component Testing & Demo Environment");
    // ...
}
```

**Result:** All startup logs (including early DEBUG logs) are captured in ring buffer and available when client connects.

**Bug #3: Same-Timestamp Log Dropping**

**Problem:** When multiple logs fired within the same millisecond (common during startup), only the first log was sent to clients. Subsequent logs with the same timestamp were dropped.

**Root Cause:** Debug server used `>` (greater than) for timestamp comparison:
```cpp
// OLD CODE (WRONG):
if (entry.timestamp > lastSentTimestamp) {
    // Send log
    lastSentTimestamp = entry.timestamp;
}
// Logs with same timestamp as lastSent are DROPPED but already consumed from ring buffer!
```

**Fix:** Changed to `>=` to handle multiple logs with same timestamp:
```cpp
// NEW CODE (CORRECT):
if (entry.timestamp >= lastSentTimestamp) {
    // Send log
    lastSentTimestamp = entry.timestamp;
}
```

**Result:** All logs sent to client, even when multiple fire in the same millisecond.

**Performance Impact:**
- Debug server initialization: ~1ms (one-time at startup)
- Message formatting: ~100-500ns per log (acceptable for DEVELOPMENT_BUILD only)
- Lock-free ring buffer writes: ~10-20ns (unchanged)
- **Total impact: Negligible** (~1ms startup delay, sub-microsecond per log)

**Testing:**
- Verified DEBUG logs from all categories appear in developer client
- Verified console still filters logs by level (UI category set to Info, DEBUG logs hidden in console but visible in browser)
- Verified early startup logs appear in browser
- Verified repeating logs (frame counter) stream correctly
- Verified all INFO logs appear (no more missing logs due to timestamp collision)

**Files Modified:**
- `libs/foundation/utils/log.cpp` - Reordered Logger::Log() to send to debug server before filtering
- `libs/foundation/debug/debug_server.cpp` - Fixed timestamp comparison (> to >=)
- `apps/ui-sandbox/main.cpp` - Moved debug server initialization to very beginning

**Impact:**
Complete observability for development - ALL logs now stream to developer client regardless of console filtering, enabling full debugging without console noise.

### 2025-10-27 - String Hashing System Implementation

**Core Engine Pattern Complete:**

Implemented a production-ready compile-time string hashing system using the FNV-1a algorithm. This is a foundational pattern that will be used throughout the codebase for fast string comparisons and lookups.

**Implementation:**
- **FNV-1a hash function**: 64-bit constexpr hash function for compile-time and runtime hashing
- **HASH() macro**: Convenience macro for compile-time hashing of string literals
- **Common hash constants**: Pre-defined hashes for common strings (Transform, Position, Velocity, etc.)
- **Debug collision detection**: Debug-only hash registry that asserts on collisions
- **String lookup**: Reverse lookup function for debugging (maps hash back to original string)

**Key Features:**
- **Compile-time evaluation**: String literal hashes computed at compile-time (zero runtime cost)
- **100-1000x faster** than string comparison for lookups in hot paths
- **Header-only**: No .cpp file needed, easy to use anywhere
- **Type-safe**: Using `StringHash` type alias (uint64_t) instead of raw integers
- **Debug support**: Collision detection and reverse lookup only in Debug builds

**Use Cases:**
- ECS component type identification
- Resource loading and caching (texture/shader paths)
- Config file JSON key lookups
- Event system type identification
- Debug command dispatch

**Performance:**
- Compile-time hashing: Zero runtime cost (inlined constant)
- Runtime hashing: ~10-20 CPU cycles for typical strings
- Collision probability: ~0.00000003% for 10,000 strings in 64-bit space

**Files Created:**
- `libs/foundation/utils/string_hash.h` - Complete implementation with documentation

**Next Integration Points:**
- ECS system (component type lookups)
- Resource manager (asset path caching)
- Config system (JSON key parsing)

**Documentation:**
- Design: `/docs/technical/string-hashing.md` (pre-existing)
- Implementation follows spec exactly (FNV-1a, 64-bit, compile-time)

### 2025-10-27 - Developer Client Implementation - Complete Feature Set

**Client-Side History, localStorage Persistence, and SVG Charting:**

Implemented all features designed in the technical documentation with clean separation of concerns and proper styling architecture.

**Core Infrastructure:**
- **CircularBuffer utility class**: Generic fixed-size rolling window with O(1) insert, properly handles capacity changes
- **LocalStorageService**: State persistence with automatic cleanup, quota management, error handling, graceful degradation

**TimeSeriesChart Component (Generic, SVG-based):**
- **Generic reusable component** - no hardcoded metric types
- Real-time time-series visualization using SVG with normalized viewBox (0-1 coordinates)
- Auto-scaling Y-axis based on data range with 10% padding
- Compact 60px height (less than 100px requirement)
- Current value displayed from last item in array
- **All styling in CSS** - no inline styles, colors, or sizes in React code
- CSS class variants for different metric colors (fps, frameTime, drawCalls, vertices, triangles)

**Multiple Metrics Display:**
- **5 separate charts** displayed simultaneously in column layout:
  - FPS (green)
  - Frame Time (yellow)
  - Draw Calls (blue)
  - Vertices (magenta)
  - Triangles (cyan)
- Min/Max frame time stats row
- All charts share single circular buffer for history
- Each chart extracts its metric values from shared history

**LogViewer Component:**
- Array-based log storage with count limits (500 / 1000 / 2000 / 5000)
- Filter by log level (Debug+ / Info+ / Warning+ / Error)
- Text search (case-insensitive)
- Auto-scroll detection (preserves manual scroll position)
- Color-coded by level (DEBUG gray, INFO white, WARN yellow, ERROR red)
- File:line display for warnings/errors
- Count limit dropdown integrated into component header
- localStorage integration (restore logs on mount)

**App.tsx Integration:**
- **Single circular buffer** for all metrics (not per-chart)
- localStorage persistence on mount/unmount (not continuous)
- State restoration from localStorage on page load
- **Proper retention window handling**: Recreates buffer when window changes, preserves existing history
- "Clear History" button in header (affects both metrics and logs)
- **Retention window control with metrics** (30s/1min/5min/10min) - doesn't affect logs
- System log entries for connection events

**UI Layout:**
- Time window selector moved to Metrics section (only affects metrics)
- Clear History button in header (affects both metrics and logs)
- Connection status indicator in header
- Two-column layout: Metrics (left) | Logs (right)

**Design Changes:**
- **Canvas → SVG**: Per user preference, using declarative SVG rendering
- **Generic chart component**: TimeSeriesChart takes `values` array, no metric-specific logic
- **CSS-only styling**: All colors, sizes, spacing controlled via CSS modules and variables
- Updated documentation throughout to reflect SVG approach

**Build Output:**
- Single HTML file: 671 KB (gzip: 201 KB)
- All JavaScript and CSS inlined
- Works with `file://` protocol

- Auto-builds in Development/Debug mode
- Output copied to build/developer-client/

### 2025-10-27 - Developer Client Documentation - Architecture & Design Refinement

**Documentation Quality Improvement:**

Refactored and expanded the developer client technical documentation to follow project best practices for design documents.

**Phase 1: Refactoring (920 → 359 lines)**

Removed production-ready code implementations and replaced with architectural design:
- Removed complete React component implementations (MetricsChart, LogViewer, HoverInspector with full code)
- Removed complete CSS modules with every style property
- Removed line-by-line tutorial code
- Replaced with component responsibilities described conceptually
- Replaced with architectural patterns and design decisions
- Focused on WHY decisions were made, not HOW to implement

**Phase 2: Expansion (359 → 681 lines)**

Added comprehensive design for client-side data management:

**Client-Side History Aggregation:**
- Server does NOT aggregate or store history (streams current values only)
- Client maintains rolling history buffer for visualization
- Rationale: Server stays stateless, client controls retention, browser has sufficient memory

**Configurable Retention Policies:**
- Metrics: Time-based (30s / 60s / 5min / 10min)
- Logs: Count-based (500 / 1000 / 2000 / 5000 entries)
- Different strategies because metrics are dense time-series, logs are sparse events

**localStorage Persistence Strategy:**
- Preserves history and preferences across page reloads
- Persistence lifecycle: Read on mount, write on unmount (not continuous)
- Automatic cleanup: Age-based trimming, size monitoring, quota management
- Error handling: Graceful degradation if disabled, automatic recovery on quota exceeded

**Time-Series Graphing:**
- Canvas 2D rendering for performance
- Rolling time window with auto-scrolling X-axis
- Auto-scaling Y-axis based on data range
- Multi-series support (multiple metrics on one chart)
- Grid rendering and current value overlay

**Performance & Storage Considerations:**
- Memory calculations: < 400 KB metrics, < 1.5 MB logs, < 2 MB total typical
- localStorage performance: 10-50ms read/write on mount/unmount only
- Canvas rendering: 2-12ms per frame (well within 16ms budget)
- Circular buffer for metrics (O(1) insert, fixed memory)
- Array for logs (simpler, order matters for historical record)
- Storage quota: < 5 MB target (works on all browsers)

**Files Modified:**
- `/docs/technical/observability/developer-client.md` - Refactored and expanded (920 → 359 → 681 lines)

**Documentation Standard Achieved:**
- Focuses on architecture and design decisions (WHY/WHAT)
- Explains rationale and tradeoffs for key decisions
- Includes small conceptual code snippets only where helpful (circular buffer example, quota management pattern)
- No production-ready copy-paste implementations
- Actual codebase remains source of truth for implementation
- Follows project standard: "Code in technical docs should describe or demonstrate HOW something complex should be done, not have actual production code"

### 2025-10-27 - Developer Client - TypeScript Web UI for Debug Server

│  - Running in ui-sandbox/world-sim          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Usage Workflow:**
```bash
# Build C++ app with developer client
cd build && make

# Run application (debug server starts on port 8081)
./apps/ui-sandbox/ui-sandbox

# Open developer client in browser
open build/developer-client/index.html

# Restart app as many times as needed - client auto-reconnects
```

**Files Created:**
- `apps/developer-client/src/App.tsx` - Main application component
- `apps/developer-client/src/App.module.css` - Scoped styles
- `apps/developer-client/src/main.tsx` - Application entry point
- `apps/developer-client/src/services/ServerConnection.ts` - SSE connection manager

**Build Configuration:**
- CMake target `developer-client` (ALL builds in Debug/Development)
- Runs `npm install` and `npm run build` automatically
- Copies output to `build/developer-client/`
- world-sim and ui-sandbox depend on developer-client target

**Design Decisions:**
- Single HTML file for portability (works without web server)
- Inline source maps (debugging without separate .map files)
- EventSource over WebSocket (simpler for one-way streaming, auto-reconnect)
- 1000-log buffer limit (prevents browser memory issues)
- System category for client-side events (connection status)
- Matching C++ log level strings (`WARN` not `WARNING`)

**Testing:**
- Verified metrics update in real-time at 10 Hz
- Confirmed logs stream with correct color coding
- Tested disconnect/reconnect with ui-sandbox restarts
- Validated source maps in browser dev tools
- Confirmed build integration with CMake

**Next Steps:**
- Add log filtering by category/level (UI controls)
- Add log search functionality
- Consider adding performance charts (FPS over time)
- Consider adding profiler stream visualization
- Add download logs as text file

### 2025-10-26 - Observability Web UI with Real-Time Logging

**Complete Observability Stack Operational:**

Extended the debug server with real-time log streaming and a tabbed web interface, providing full observability for development.

**Architecture - Lock-Free Performance Guarantee:**

**CRITICAL DESIGN CONSTRAINT: Performance > Complete Logs**
- Logger writes to lock-free ring buffer (~10-20ns, never blocks game thread)
- If ring buffer full (1000 entries): **oldest logs silently dropped**
- Zero mutex/locks in game thread path
- HTTP server reads from ring buffer at 10 Hz (throttled)

**LogEntry Structure** (`Foundation::LogEntry`):
```cpp
struct LogEntry {
    LogLevel level;           // Debug/Info/Warning/Error
    LogCategory category;     // Renderer/Physics/Audio/Network/Game/World/UI/Engine/Foundation
    char message[256];        // Formatted log message
    uint64_t timestamp;       // Unix timestamp in milliseconds
    const char* file;         // Source file (static string pointer)
    int line;                 // Line number
};
```

**Integration Flow:**
1. `LOG_INFO(Renderer, "message")` → Logger::Log()
2. Logger formats message, writes to console (colored)
3. Logger calls `debugServer->UpdateLog()` (lock-free, ~10-20ns)
4. DebugServer writes to `LockFreeRingBuffer<LogEntry, 1000>`
5. HTTP `/stream/logs` endpoint reads from buffer at 10 Hz
6. Browser receives Server-Sent Events with JSON log entries

**Web UI - Tabbed Interface:**

**Tab 1: Performance** (existing)
- Real-time metrics: FPS, frame time (min/max/current), draw calls, vertices, triangles
- Updates via `/stream/metrics` SSE endpoint (10 Hz)

**Tab 2: Logs** (NEW)
- Real-time log viewer with auto-scroll
- Color-coded by level:
  - Debug: Gray (#808080)
  - Info: White (#d4d4d4)
  - Warning: Yellow (#dcdcaa)
  - Error: Red (#f48771)
- Shows: timestamp, category, level, message
- File:line for warnings/errors
- Limit: 500 logs (prevents browser memory issues)
- Updates via `/stream/logs` SSE endpoint (10 Hz)

**HTTP Endpoints:**
- `GET /` - Tabbed web UI (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- `GET /api/health` - Health check (JSON)
- `GET /api/metrics` - Current metrics snapshot (JSON)
- `GET /stream/metrics` - Real-time metrics stream (SSE, 10 Hz)
- `GET /stream/logs` - Real-time log stream (SSE, 10 Hz) **NEW**

**Logger Integration:**
- Added `Logger::SetDebugServer(DebugServer*)` static method
- Logger stores static pointer to debug server
- On each log call, sends to debug server (only in DEVELOPMENT_BUILD)
- Conversion between `foundation::` and `Foundation::` enums
- Properly disconnects on shutdown (prevents use-after-free)

**ui-sandbox Wiring:**
```cpp
// After creating debug server
foundation::Logger::SetDebugServer(&debugServer);

// Before destroying debug server
foundation::Logger::SetDebugServer(nullptr);
```

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `libs/foundation/debug/debug_server.{h,cpp}` - Added LogEntry struct, UpdateLog(), /stream/logs endpoint
- `libs/foundation/debug/debug_server.cpp` - Rewrote HTML UI with tabs, log viewer, SSE streaming
- `libs/foundation/utils/log.{h,cpp}` - Added DebugServer integration, enum conversion
- `apps/ui-sandbox/main.cpp` - Wired Logger to DebugServer

**Testing:**
- Verified logger connects to debug server on startup
- Confirmed logs stream to browser in real-time
- Tested tab navigation (Performance ↔ Logs)
- Verified color-coded log levels
- Confirmed auto-scroll and 500-log limit
- Tested under load: no frame drops, logs may be dropped (by design)

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Game thread log overhead: ~10-20ns (lock-free write to ring buffer)
- HTTP streaming: 10 Hz (not real-time, throttled to prevent bandwidth issues)
- If logging faster than HTTP can consume: oldest logs dropped silently
- Zero performance impact even if debug server is slow/stuck

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run ui-sandbox (debug server on port 8081 by default)
./ui-sandbox

# Open web UI in browser
open http://localhost:8081

# Switch between Performance and Logs tabs
# Logs stream in real-time with color coding
```

**Next Steps:**
- Consider adding log filtering in web UI (by category/level)
- Consider adding log search functionality
- Consider adding download logs as text file

### 2025-10-26 - Structured Logging System Implementation

**Core Engine Pattern Complete:**

Implemented a production-ready structured logging system for the entire project, providing organized diagnostic output with categories and log levels.

**System Architecture:**

**Logger Class** (`libs/foundation/utils/log.{h,cpp}`):
- Four log levels: Debug, Info, Warning, Error
- Nine categories: Renderer, Physics, Audio, Network, Game, World, UI, Engine, Foundation
- Per-category level filtering (set different verbosity for each system)
- Automatic timestamping (HH:MM:SS format)
- ANSI color codes for terminal output (gray/white/yellow/red)
- File and line number capture for warnings and errors

**Convenience Macros:**
```cpp
LOG_DEBUG(category, format, ...)
LOG_INFO(category, format, ...)
LOG_WARNING(category, format, ...)
LOG_ERROR(category, format, ...)
```

**Build Configuration:**
- Development builds: All log levels available, `DEVELOPMENT_BUILD` flag enables Debug/Info/Warning
- Release builds: Only Error logs remain, Debug/Info/Warning compile to `((void)0)`
- CMake automatically sets flag for Debug and RelWithDebInfo build types

**Usage Examples:**
```cpp
LOG_INFO(Renderer, "Initializing renderer: %dx%d", width, height);
LOG_ERROR(Network, "Failed to connect to server");
LOG_DEBUG(Physics, "Tick took %f ms", deltaTime);
```

**Output Format:**
```
[19:08:10][UI][INFO] UI Sandbox - Component Testing & Demo Environment
[19:08:10][Renderer][INFO] OpenGL Version: 4.1 ATI-7.0.23
[19:08:11][Foundation][INFO] Debug server: http://localhost:8081
```

**Design Decision - Macro Naming:**

Chose **unprefixed global macros** (`LOG_ERROR` not `WSIM_LOG_ERROR`) for developer experience:
- **Pros**: Cleaner code, better readability, shorter is better for ubiquitous operations
- **Cons**: Potential conflicts with other libraries defining similar macros
- **Mitigation**: Game project (not library), we control dependencies, can refactor if needed
- **Documented**: Tradeoff explicitly documented in `/docs/technical/logging-system.md`

**Integration:**
- ui-sandbox fully converted to use logging system (replaced all `std::cout`/`std::cerr`)
- Foundation library exports logger for use by all other libraries
- Initialized in `main()` before any other systems

**Testing:**
- Verified colored output with timestamps in terminal
- Confirmed different categories display correctly
- Tested log level filtering (Debug logs visible in development builds)
- Verified ANSI color codes work on macOS terminal

**Future HTTP Streaming Integration:**

Documentation includes design for lock-free ring buffer + Server-Sent Events streaming to external debug app (from `/docs/technical/observability/developer-server.md`), to be implemented when needed.

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `libs/foundation/utils/log.h` - Logger class, enums, macros (NEW)
- `libs/foundation/utils/log.cpp` - Implementation with console output (NEW)
- `libs/foundation/CMakeLists.txt` - Added log.cpp, DEVELOPMENT_BUILD flag
- `apps/ui-sandbox/main.cpp` - Converted all output to logging system
- `docs/technical/logging-system.md` - Added macro naming convention section

**Next Engine Pattern:**
String hashing system (FNV-1a with compile-time hashing)

### 2025-10-26 - Pixel-Perfect UI Rendering & Window Sizing

**Fixed Critical Rendering Bug:**

The primitive rendering system was using a hardcoded 800x600 virtual coordinate system, causing shapes to physically change pixel dimensions when the window was resized. This violated the design specification for 1:1 pixel mapping.

**Root Cause:**
- Projection matrix was `ortho(0, 800, 600, 0)` regardless of actual framebuffer size
- `Rect(50, 50, 200, 100)` would be 320px wide in an 1280x720 window, but 640px wide in a 2560x1440 window
- Shapes scaled with window resize, breaking pixel-perfect rendering

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed projection matrix to use actual framebuffer dimensions: `ortho(0, m_viewportWidth, m_viewportHeight, 0)`
- Added `SetViewport(width, height)` to BatchRenderer and Primitives API
- Called `SetViewport()` on window creation and framebuffer resize callback
- Now `Rect(50, 50, 200, 100)` is **always exactly 200×100 pixels**, regardless of window size

**UI Sandbox Improvements:**
- Window now launches at 80% of screen size (was hardcoded 800x600)
- Queries primary monitor via GLFW to calculate appropriate initial size
- Created demo system structure (`demos/demo.h`, `demos/shapes_demo.cpp`)
- Moved rendering code from `main.cpp` to proper demo implementation
- Console output shows screen and window dimensions on startup

**Industry Standard Alignment:**
- RmlUI uses pixel coordinates with 1:1 mapping (per our documentation)
- ImGui uses pixel coordinates with 1:1 mapping
- Unity UI default is "Constant Pixel Size" mode
- Our implementation now matches these standards

**Files Modified:**
- `libs/renderer/primitives/batch_renderer.{h,cpp}` - Added viewport tracking, fixed projection matrix
- `libs/renderer/primitives/primitives.{h,cpp}` - Exposed SetViewport() API
- `apps/ui-sandbox/main.cpp` - Added monitor querying, demo system integration, viewport updates
- `apps/ui-sandbox/demos/demo.h` - Created demo interface (NEW)
- `apps/ui-sandbox/demos/shapes_demo.cpp` - Implemented shapes demo (NEW)
- `apps/ui-sandbox/CMakeLists.txt` - Added shapes_demo.cpp to build

**Test Results:**
```
Screen: 3200x1800
Window: 2560x1440 (80% of screen)
```

Shapes now maintain constant pixel dimensions when window is resized. ✅

### 2025-10-27 - UI Sandbox Implementation + Lock-Free Performance Monitoring

**UI Sandbox Foundation - Fully Operational:**

Built complete ui-sandbox development tool with working primitive rendering and real-time performance monitoring:

**Primitive Rendering API Implemented:**
- `DrawRect()`, `DrawLine()`, `DrawRectBorder()` - Basic 2D shape primitives
- Batching system with OpenGL 3.3 shaders (vertex + fragment)
- Batch accumulator minimizes draw calls (single draw per batch)
- Transform and scissor stacks (for world-space rendering and clipping)
- Color type with common presets (Red, Green, Blue, etc.)
- Rect type with collision helpers (Contains, Intersects, Intersection)

**Performance Monitoring System:**
- **Lock-free ring buffer** (atomic operations only, zero mutex contention)
- HTTP Debug Server on port 8081 using cpp-httplib
- REST endpoints: `/api/health`, `/api/metrics`
- Server-Sent Events stream: `/stream/metrics` (10 Hz updates)
- HTML UI at `http://localhost:8081` with live metrics
- Metrics tracked: FPS, frame time (min/max/current), draw calls, vertices, triangles

**Critical Architecture Fix:**
- Initial implementation used `std::mutex` (WRONG - could block game thread!)
- Replaced with lock-free ring buffer per observability spec
- Game thread writes: ~10-20 nanoseconds (was 100-1000ns uncontended, 1-10ms contended)
- HTTP thread reads: ~10-20 nanoseconds
- **Zero possibility of frame drops from monitoring** ✅

**Performance Test Results:**
- Normal operation: **~1370 FPS** (0.73ms frame time)
- Stress test (50 concurrent curl requests): **9009 FPS** (0.11ms frame time)
- Frame time range: 0.08ms - 2.34ms (max likely OS scheduler)
- Draw calls: 1 (batching working correctly)
- **No frame drops observed under HTTP load** ✅

**Files Created (17 files):**
- `libs/foundation/math/types.h` - GLM type aliases (Vec2, Vec3, Mat4)
- `libs/foundation/graphics/{color.h, rect.h}` - Core graphics types
- `libs/foundation/metrics/performance_metrics.{h,cpp}` - Metrics data structure + JSON serialization
- `libs/foundation/debug/debug_server.{h,cpp}` - HTTP server with SSE streaming
- `libs/foundation/debug/lock_free_ring_buffer.h` - Lock-free template from observability spec
- `libs/renderer/primitives/primitives.{h,cpp}` - Public 2D drawing API
- `libs/renderer/primitives/batch_renderer.{h,cpp}` - OpenGL batching implementation
- `libs/renderer/metrics/metrics_collector.{h,cpp}` - Frame timing + stats collection
- `apps/ui-sandbox/main.cpp` - Complete rewrite with metrics integration

**Build System:**
- vcpkg.json baseline updated (8f54ef5453e7e76ff01e15988bf243e7247c5eb5)
- CMake configured with toolchain
- All dependencies installed (GLFW, GLEW, GLM, cpp-httplib)
- Foundation library changed from INTERFACE to regular library

**Testing:**
```bash
# Run ui-sandbox with debug server (default port 8081)
./ui-sandbox

# Query current metrics
curl http://localhost:8081/api/metrics
# {"fps": 1369.86, "frameTimeMs": 0.73, "drawCalls": 1, ...}

# Stream live metrics (10 updates/second)
curl -N http://localhost:8081/stream/metrics

# Open browser for visual monitoring
open http://localhost:8081
```

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Lock-free observability is **non-negotiable** for zero-overhead monitoring
- ui-sandbox is always a dev tool (no Release build guards needed)
- Default port 8081 for ui-sandbox debug server
- Primitive API as foundation for both custom rendering AND RmlUI backend

**Next Steps:**
1. Add text rendering to Primitive API (basic font support)
2. Integrate RmlUI for complex UI panels
3. Implement RmlUI backend using Primitive API
4. Build developer client (TypeScript/Vite) for advanced metrics visualization

### 2025-10-26 - UI Framework Architecture - Complete Design

**Critical Gap Addressed:**

Comprehensive planning exists for vector graphics rendering and procedural tile systems, but **no technical design for UI framework** - a foundational requirement for ui-sandbox and complex game UI (inventory grids, skill trees, resource management).

**Production game context established:** This is not a learning project - need production-quality UI for complex management game with thousands of dynamic UI elements.

**User Context:**
- Web/React developer background (familiar with declarative UI)
- Previous C++ project used modern designated initializer syntax (`.position = value`)
- Hit scrolling container issues (performance/clipping in OpenGL)
- Wants crisp text rendering matching vector aesthetic

**Documentation Created** (`/docs/technical/ui-framework/`):

**Seven comprehensive design documents:**

1. **INDEX.md** - Navigation hub for UI framework documentation
   - Desired API style examples (CSS-like `.Args{}` syntax)
   - Integration with observability system
   - Common UI patterns (menus, forms, HUD)

2. **ui-architecture-fundamentals.md** - Foundational concepts for production games
   - Immediate vs retained mode explained in React/web terms
   - Scene graphs = React's virtual DOM
   - What production games actually use (Unity, Unreal, indies)
   - RmlUI as HTML/CSS for C++ games
   - Clear recommendation: Retained mode for complex game UI

3. **library-options.md** - Initial comparative analysis (6 libraries)
   - Later superseded by fundamentals doc with production focus

4. **integration-analysis.md** - Technical integration deep dive
   - Immediate vs retained mode in React terms
   - OpenGL rendering models (who draws what)
   - Transitive dependencies for each library
   - Rendering conflict analysis (NanoVG issues)
   - Backend implementation examples
   - Dependency table (RmlUI: FreeType, NanoGUI: NanoVG+Eigen)

5. **library-isolation-strategy.md** - Risk mitigation and architecture isolation
   - Interface pattern to isolate RmlUI from game code
   - What CAN be isolated (game logic, event handlers)
   - What CANNOT be isolated (.rml files, data binding syntax)
   - Hidden constraints (threading, memory management, font rendering)
   - Conflicts with project goals analysis
   - Migration cost assessment (1-2 weeks simple, 4-8 weeks complex)
   - Prototype-first recommendation

6. **rendering-boundaries.md** - Critical architectural boundaries
   - **The "two different APIs" problem identified**
   - RmlUI for screen-space panels only (menus, inventory, skill trees)
   - Custom rendering for game world (tiles, entities)
   - Custom rendering for world-space UI (health bars, tooltips)
   - **Solution: Unified Primitive Rendering API**
   - Complete render loop architecture
   - Real-world examples (RimWorld, Factorio, Unity, Unreal)

7. **primitive-rendering-api.md** - Foundation layer design
   - Unified API for all 2D drawing (DrawRect, DrawText, DrawTexture)
   - Used by RmlUI backend, game rendering, world-space UI
   - Immediate mode API, retained mode implementation (batching)
   - Scissor/clipping stack for scrollable containers
   - Transform stack for world-space rendering
   - Integration with existing renderer and vector graphics
   - Performance targets (<1ms per frame for all primitives)
   - Complete code examples (health bars, tooltips, minimap)

8. **rmlui-integration-architecture.md** - Complete integration design
   - Multi-layer architecture (game → interface → adapter → RmlUI → primitives)
   - IUISystem, IDocument, IElement abstract interfaces
   - RmlUI adapter hidden in .cpp files (game never sees RmlUI headers)
   - Renderer backend (RmlUI geometry → Primitives API)
   - Three usage patterns: XML, programmatic, hybrid
   - Complete game loop integration example
   - CMake configuration with private RmlUI linking
   - Testing strategy (unit tests with mock, integration tests with real)
   - Migration strategy (game code unchanged, rewrite adapter only)

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

**1. RmlUI for Screen-Space Complex UI**
- HTML/CSS-like markup for complex layouts (inventory grids, skill trees)
- Flexbox layout engine (handles nested containers automatically)
- Can be used programmatically (NO .rml files required)
- Isolated via interface layer (game code never depends on RmlUI)

**2. Unified Primitive Rendering API**
- **Solves "two different APIs for rectangles" problem**
- One DrawRect/DrawText/DrawTexture API used by everything:
  - RmlUI backend
  - Game world rendering
  - World-space UI (health bars)
  - Custom UI components
- Batching implementation (minimize draw calls)
- Integration with existing renderer

**3. Clear Rendering Boundaries**
- **RmlUI**: Screen-space panels only (menus, inventory, dialogs)
- **Custom/Primitives**: Game world + world-space UI + simple HUD
- **Vector Graphics**: Complex SVG entities (trees, decorations)
- No overlap or confusion about which system to use

**4. Isolation Strategy**
- Game code depends on IUISystem/IDocument/IElement interfaces
- RmlUI adapter hidden in private .cpp files
- CMake links RmlUI privately (not exposed to game)
- Migration cost: Rewrite adapter (~500 lines), game code unchanged

**Critical Insights:**

**Production Game Requirements Clarified:**
- Not a learning project or toy
- Complex management game UI (thousands of elements)
- Inventory grids, skill trees, resource management panels
- Performance critical (60 FPS with dynamic updates)

**RmlUI Programmatic API Discovery:**
- Can create all UI from C++ (NO .rml files required)
- Avoids markup file lock-in
- Enables `.Args{}` wrapper pattern
- Still get flexbox layout engine benefits

**Text Rendering:**
- RmlUI requires FreeType (can't avoid)
- Can write custom font backend using msdfgen for SDF fonts
- Integration point with vector graphics system

**Scrolling Containers:**
- OpenGL scissor test (hardware clipping)
- RmlUI handles automatically
- Primitives API exposes PushScissor/PopScissor for custom usage

**Next Steps:**

1. ✅ **Complete architecture documentation** (DONE)
2. **Prototype RmlUI integration** (1-2 weeks)
   - Implement primitive rendering API
   - Build RmlUI backend + isolation layer
   - Create one complex UI panel (inventory or skill tree)
   - Validate performance and integration
3. **Evaluate prototype results**
   - Does flexbox handle layouts?
   - Is performance acceptable?
   - Are constraints manageable?
4. **Make final decision**
   - Commit to RmlUI if prototype succeeds
   - Build custom if critical issues found

**Documentation Organization:**
- Created `/docs/technical/ui-framework/` subdirectory
- Updated `/docs/technical/INDEX.md` with UI Framework section
- All documents cross-referenced and navigable

### 2025-10-26 - OpenGL + RmlUI Implementation Guide - Production-Ready Rendering Layer

**Critical Missing Piece:**

Architecture was complete, but **no implementation guidance** for actually building the OpenGL rendering layer with RmlUI integration. User asked: "How should we set up our rendering layer according to RmlUI best practices? Do they have a guide for a production ready game for the OpenGL setup?"

**Research Conducted:**

Comprehensive research of RmlUI's official documentation, reference implementations, and production best practices:

1. **RmlUI Official Documentation** (mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc)
   - RenderInterface specification (`<RmlUi/Core/RenderInterface.h>`)
   - Integration guide and main loop patterns
   - Troubleshooting and common mistakes
   - Rendering conventions and coordinate system requirements

2. **GL3 Reference Backend Analysis** (`RmlUi_Renderer_GL3.cpp`)
   - Complete class structure and implementation patterns
   - Vertex buffer management (VAO/VBO/IBO)
   - Shader architecture (9 programs for various effects)
   - State backup/restore implementation
   - Scissor region handling with Y-flip
   - Transform dirty flag pattern

3. **Production Integration Patterns**
   - Main loop order (Input → Update → Render)
   - Initialization sequence (interfaces → initialize → context → fonts → documents)
   - State management requirements
   - Performance profiling approaches

**Documentation Created:**

**opengl-rmlui-implementation-guide.md** - Comprehensive production-ready implementation guide (~2000 lines)

**10 Major Sections:**

1. **OpenGL Rendering Architecture**
   - Complete render pipeline (world → world UI → screen UI)
   - Three-layer architecture (RmlUI → Backend → Primitives → OpenGL)
   - Batching strategy decision (where to batch, how it works)

2. **Coordinate System Conventions**
   - RmlUI vs OpenGL origin mismatch (top-left vs bottom-left)
   - Y-axis flipping for projection matrix
   - Scissor region Y-coordinate transformation
   - Color space (sRGB with premultiplied alpha)
   - Blend function: `glBlendFunc(GL_ONE, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)`
   - Face culling (CCW winding)

3. **RmlUI Backend Implementation**
   - Complete `RmlUIBackend` class implementing `Rml::RenderInterface`
   - Geometry compilation strategy (immediate GPU upload with VAO/VBO/IBO)
   - `CompileGeometry()` implementation with vertex attributes
   - `RenderGeometry()` options (direct OpenGL vs Primitive API)
   - Texture management (`LoadTexture()` and `GenerateTexture()`)
   - Scissor implementation with Y-flip
   - Transform support with dirty flags

4. **Primitive API OpenGL Implementation**
   - `BatchAccumulator` class design
   - Batching by texture/state/transform/scissor
   - Flush triggers (state changes, max batch size, frame end)
   - Vertex buffer strategy (dynamic upload, capacity management)
   - Draw call accumulation and rendering

5. **Integration Patterns**
   - **Critical main loop order** (violations cause crashes/glitches)
   - Initialization sequence (order matters!)
   - Shutdown sequence (backend must outlive RmlUI)
   - Input injection (RmlUI doesn't convert keys to text!)
   - Viewport handling on resize

6. **State Management** - **CRITICAL**
   - Why state backup/restore is mandatory
   - Complete `GLState` structure (20+ state variables)
   - `BackupGLState()` implementation
   - `RestoreGLState()` implementation
   - `BeginFrame()` / `EndFrame()` lifecycle

7. **Production Best Practices**
   - Always backup/restore state (non-negotiable)
   - Preserve render order (never batch/reorder RmlUI calls)
   - Handle viewport changes correctly
   - Use visual testing suite
   - Integrate RmlUI debugger
   - Profile early and often
   - Load fonts before documents
   - Handle interface lifetimes correctly
   - Implement high-resolution timer
   - Copy reference backend, don't link it

8. **Common Pitfalls** (10 documented issues)
   - Face culling blank screen (DirectX vs OpenGL winding)
   - Upside-down UI (forgot Y-flip)
   - Scissor regions incorrect (forgot Y-flip)
   - Crash on shutdown (destroyed backend too early)
   - Text not rendering (fonts not loaded)
   - Slow animations (low-resolution timer)
   - State corruption (no backup/restore)
   - Modifying elements after Update (causes crashes)
   - Incorrect initialization order
   - Premultiplied alpha confusion

9. **Performance Considerations**
   - Expected performance (reference vs batched)
   - Profiling strategy (separate Update vs Render time)
   - Optimization targets (< 2ms for complex UI)
   - Batching effectiveness measurement
   - Memory usage expectations

10. **Testing and Validation**
    - RmlUI visual test suite usage
    - Integration testing examples
    - Debug visualization
    - Logging and diagnostics

**Key Technical Discoveries:**

**RmlUI Reference Backend Does NOT Batch:**
- Each `RenderGeometry()` call = one draw call
- Prioritizes correctness and transform flexibility
- Simple, battle-tested approach
- **Our architecture batches at Primitive API layer below**

**Critical Coordinate System Details:**
```cpp
// Projection matrix MUST flip Y-axis
glm::ortho(0, width, height, 0, -1, 1);  // Note: bottom/top swapped

// Scissor regions need Y-flip
int flippedY = viewportHeight - region.p1.y;
glScissor(region.p0.x, flippedY, width, height);
```

**State Management is Non-Negotiable:**
- Must backup/restore 20+ OpenGL state variables
- Reference backend does comprehensive state preservation
- Failure causes subtle rendering corruption bugs
- `BeginFrame()` → backup + setup, `EndFrame()` → restore

**Main Loop Order is Critical:**
```cpp
// CORRECT order (violations cause crashes/glitches):
ProcessInput();           // 1. Input BEFORE update
UpdateUIDataBindings();   // 2. Modify elements
context->Update();        // 3. Update (resolves layout)
// 4. NEVER modify elements here!
context->Render();        // 5. Render
```

**Initialization Order Matters:**
```cpp
// CORRECT sequence:
Rml::SetRenderInterface(backend);   // 1. Set interfaces
Rml::SetSystemInterface(&system);
Rml::Initialise();                  // 2. Initialize
CreateContext();                    // 3. Create context
Rml::LoadFontFace("font.ttf");      // 4. Load fonts
context->LoadDocument("menu.rml");  // 5. Load documents
```

**Batching Strategy Decision:**
- **Reference backend**: No batching (immediate rendering)
- **Our architecture**: Batch at Primitive API layer
- RmlUI backend uploads geometry to GPU (like reference)
- But calls Primitive API instead of raw OpenGL
- Primitive API accumulates and batches draw calls
- **Result**: Battle-tested geometry compilation + performance batching

**Performance Targets:**
- Simple UI: < 0.5ms per frame
- Complex UI (inventory grid): < 2ms per frame
- Expected batching ratio: 5-10x (1000 calls → 100 draw calls)

**Production Patterns from Reference Backend:**
- `GL_STATIC_DRAW` for vertex/index data (RmlUI guarantees immutability)
- Comprehensive state backup (blend, depth, stencil, culling, scissor, viewport, bindings)
- Y-flip transformation for scissor regions
- Clamping scissor to viewport (prevents WebGL validation errors)
- Dirty flag pattern for transform matrices
- Per-program uniform location caching

**Documentation Updated:**
- Updated `INDEX.md` status to "Implementation Phase: Architecture complete"
- Added implementation guide to "Implementation Guides" section
- Updated "Next Steps" with concrete implementation tasks
- Added revision history entry

**Next Steps:**

Architecture and implementation guide complete. Ready to begin coding:

1. **Implement Primitive Rendering API** (`libs/renderer/`)
   - BatchAccumulator for geometry batching
   - OpenGL shader setup (vertex + fragment shaders)
   - State management and batching triggers

2. **Implement RmlUI Backend** (`libs/ui/src/rmlui/`)
   - RmlUIBackend class implementing Rml::RenderInterface
   - Geometry compilation (VAO/VBO/IBO)
   - Texture loading and management
   - State backup/restore (critical!)

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Load simple RML document (colored rectangles)
   - Test scissor regions (scrolling containers)
   - Test transforms (CSS transforms)
   - Validate against RmlUI visual test suite

### 2025-10-26 - Procedural Tile System Game Design Documentation

**Major Architectural Clarification:**

Comprehensive game design documentation for the procedural tile rendering system. **Critical discovery**: Tiles are procedurally generated in code (not SVG-based), with SVG assets serving as decorations and entities placed on top of the procedural ground.

**Core Innovation - Biome Influence Percentage System:**

Tiles don't have a single "type" but instead have percentage influences from multiple biomes:
```
Example: { meadow: 80%, forest: 20% }
- Ground: 80% grass appearance, 20% forest floor appearance
- Entities: 80% wildflower spawn probability, 20% pine tree spawn probability
- Movement speed: Interpolated between meadow and forest values
```

This creates **natural ecotones** (transition zones) hundreds of tiles deep between biomes, with gradual species mixing and visual blending. Every forest-meadow edge looks different, every coastline is unique.

**Game Design Documentation Created** (7 documents):

**Core Tile System** (`/docs/design/`):
1. `visual-style.md` - Overall aesthetic direction: hand-crafted feel, recognizable biomes, organic appearance
2. `biome-ground-covers.md` - Seven ground cover types (grass, forest floor, dirt, sand, rock, wetland, water)
3. `biome-influence-system.md` - Percentage-based biome blending, natural ecotone creation
4. `tile-transitions.md` - Visual appearance of biome transition zones (complete rewrite for percentage system)
5. `procedural-variation.md` - Creating unique tiles while maintaining biome recognizability

**SVG Asset Organization** (`/docs/design/features/vector-graphics/`):
6. `svg-decorations.md` - SVG assets as placed objects (flowers, trees, boulders)
7. `svg-texture-patterns.md` - SVG patterns as fills for code-drawn shapes (brick, wood, concrete)

**Documentation Index Updates**:
- Updated `/docs/design/INDEX.md` with "Visual Design & Procedural Tile System" section
- Updated vector graphics section with organized SVG documentation links

**Three Distinct SVG Use Cases Identified:**

1. **Decorations/Entities**: Placed objects on top of procedural tiles
   - Ground decorations: flowers, pebbles, grass tufts (5-10 per tile)
   - Standing entities: trees, bushes, boulders (0-3 per tile)
   - Placement follows biome influence percentages
   - Biome-appropriate spawning (meadow flowers only in meadow-influenced tiles)

2. **Texture Patterns**: Seamlessly tiling fills for code-drawn shapes
   - Building materials: brick, wood planks, concrete, thatch
   - Terrain features: cobblestone paths, rock formations
   - Any shape/size polygon filled with hand-crafted texture
   - Pattern must tile perfectly (edges match)

3. **Animated Vegetation**: Spline-based deformation (documented previously in animated-vegetation.md)
   - Grass swaying, tree movement, player interaction
   - Real-time Bezier curve manipulation

**Key Terminology Clarifications:**

- **Ground Covers**: Physical surface types (grass, sand, rock) - permanent, code-generated
- **Biomes**: Ecological zones that determine which ground covers appear and which decorations spawn
- **Tiles**: Individual game world cells with multiple biome influence percentages
- **Ecotones**: Natural transition zones between biomes (emergent from percentage system)
- **Decorations**: Small SVG objects (flowers, pebbles)
- **Entities**: Larger SVG objects (trees, boulders, creatures)
- **Texture Patterns**: Seamlessly tiling SVG patterns for filling shapes

**Visual Rendering Layers** (bottom to top):
1. Procedural ground covers (code-generated, biome-blended)
2. SVG texture pattern fills (code-drawn shapes with SVG fills)
3. Ground SVG decorations (flowers, pebbles)
4. Standing SVG entities (trees, structures)
5. Animated SVG elements (swaying grass, trees)

**Deterministic Variation System:**

- Each tile gets deterministic seed from world position (x, y)
- Same position always generates same appearance
- Color variation within biome palette (±10-20% lightness/saturation)
- Entity placement varies (rotation, scale, position)
- Balance: recognizable biomes with endless visual variety
- Multiplayer compatible (all clients see same world)

**Design Philosophy Established:**

- **Hand-crafted illusion**: Player should think "someone carefully designed this", not "obviously procedural"
- **Recognizable not readable**: Biomes must be instantly identifiable by players
- **Variation within coherence**: Every tile unique, but biome identity maintained
- **Performance in technical docs**: Game design docs focus on player experience, not implementation
- **Separation of concerns**: Design docs describe "what/why", technical docs describe "how"

**Iterative Refinement Process:**

Multiple rounds of user feedback refined the documentation:
- Changed "readable" → "recognizable" (it's a game, not text)
- Removed performance concerns from design docs
- Removed prototyping plans from design docs
- Changed "terrain types" → "tile types" → "ground covers" (terminology evolution)
- Removed snow as ground cover (now seasonal overlay system)
- Removed code examples from design docs (belongs in technical docs)
- Split SVG documentation by use case (decorations vs patterns vs animation)

**Open Questions Documented** (for future technical design):

1. Color variation ranges (how much can grass green vary?)
2. Entity density variation (fixed or varied per tile?)
3. Scale variation ranges (trees 80%-120% of base?)
4. Cross-tile decoration continuity (coordinate or independent?)
5. Regional vs per-tile variation (macro trends or purely local?)
6. Pattern library size (how many texture patterns needed?)
7. LOD transition smoothness (fade decorations gracefully?)

**Next Steps:**

1. Create technical design documents for tile system implementation
2. Define edge blending algorithms (geometric, alpha, marching squares)
3. Specify procedural variation implementation (noise functions, seed-based generation)
4. Document terrain layer composition system
5. Specify SVG-tile integration architecture
6. Prototype procedural tile rendering in ui-sandbox

### 2025-10-24 - Vector Graphics System Research & Documentation

**Vector Graphics Rendering Strategy Complete:**

Comprehensive research and documentation phase for vector graphics rendering system. Analyzed approaches from multiple game engines (Godot, Unity, Bevy, Phaser, LibGDX) and created detailed comparative analysis of all key components.

**Documentation Created** (18 documents):

**Index Updates**:
16. Updated `/docs/technical/INDEX.md` with vector graphics section
17. Updated `/docs/design/INDEX.md` with vector graphics features

**Key Architectural Decisions**:

- **Four-Tier System**: Static backgrounds (pre-rasterized) → Semi-static structures (cached meshes) → Dynamic entities (real-time tessellation) → GPU compute (future)
- **Desktop-First**: OpenGL 3.3+ target, leverage full desktop GPU capabilities
- **CPU Tessellation Primary**: Proven approach (Godot, Unity, Phaser pattern), defer GPU compute to Tier 4
- **Custom Batched Renderer Recommended**: Best fit for 10,000+ dynamic entities @ 60 FPS
- **Hybrid Parsing**: NanoSVG (already in project) + custom metadata parsing for game data
- **Spline-Based Animation**: Real-time Bezier curve deformation for organic movement
- **Dual Geometry**: Separate render (complex) vs collision (simplified) shapes

**Comparative Analysis Completed**:
- Each component analyzed with 3+ library options plus "no library" custom implementation
- Objective pros/cons for all options
- Decision criteria frameworks (not decisions)
- Performance estimates and complexity assessments

**Performance Targets Defined**:
- 60 FPS with 10,000+ animated entities
- <2ms tessellation budget
- <100 draw calls per frame
- ~350 MB memory budget

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin prototyping in ui-sandbox (Phase 1: Basic tessellation + rendering)
2. Test tessellation options with real SVG assets
3. Validate performance assumptions
4. Make library selection decisions based on prototype results
5. Implement core rendering pipeline

### 2025-10-24 - Networking & Multiplayer Architecture

**Client/Server Architecture Finalized:**
- Two-process design from day one: `world-sim` (client) + `world-sim-server` (headless)
- Server spawns only when needed (new game/load game), not during main menu
- Client manages server lifecycle: spawn, health monitoring, graceful shutdown
- Process management handles crash detection, zombie prevention, cross-platform spawning

**Network Protocol Defined:**
- HTTP (REST) for control plane: create game, load game, chunk requests, health checks
- WebSocket for real-time gameplay: 60 Hz entity updates, player input, world events
- Hybrid approach: Control vs. data plane separation
- JSON messages initially, binary protocol (MessagePack/Protobuf) for future optimization

**Colony Sim Synchronization Strategy:**
- Four object types: Terrain (rarely changes), Flora (event-based), Structures (deltas), Entities (60 Hz)
- Batch updates for mass events: Plant plagues, fires, meteors use efficient area mutations
- Chunk-based world streaming: Client requests chunks as viewport moves, aggressive LRU caching
- SVG assets local to client, server only sends metadata (position, rotation, variant seed)

**HTTP Debug Server Specification:**
- Separate debugging system on port 8080 (independent of game server on port 9000)
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time metrics streaming at configurable rates (10 Hz default)
- Web-based debug app (TypeScript + Vite) with custom Canvas chart rendering
- Lock-free ring buffers for metrics collection (game thread writes, server thread reads)
- Rate-limited streams prevent bandwidth issues: metrics 10 Hz, logs 20 Hz throttled, profiler 5 Hz

**Technical Documentation Created:**
- `/docs/design/features/debug-server/README.md` - Debug server game design doc
- `/docs/design/features/multiplayer/README.md` - Multiplayer architecture game design doc
- `/docs/technical/http-debug-server.md` - Debug server implementation design
- `/docs/technical/multiplayer-architecture.md` - Client/server protocol and synchronization
- `/docs/technical/process-management.md` - Cross-platform process lifecycle management

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **cpp-httplib** chosen for both game server and debug server (header-only, SSE support, simple integration)
- Server-Sent Events preferred over WebSocket for debug server (one-way streaming, simpler, auto-reconnect)
- WebSocket required for game server (bidirectional, low-latency gameplay)
- Process spawning: fork/exec on Unix, CreateProcess on Windows
- Health monitoring: HTTP polling every 5s + PID checks for crash detection

**Library Organization Clarified:**
- `game-systems` is SERVER ONLY (colony simulation logic, must not depend on renderer)
- `renderer` and `ui` are CLIENT ONLY (never linked by server)
- `world` is SHARED (procedural generation algorithms)
- `engine/shared`, `engine/client`, `engine/server` split for clear separation

**Next Session Should:**
1. Begin implementing process management (client spawning server)
2. Set up cpp-httplib in vcpkg.json
3. Create basic HTTP server skeleton in `world-sim-server`
4. Implement health check endpoint
5. Test cross-platform process spawning (macOS, Windows, Linux)

### 2025-10-12 - Initial Planning Session

**Documentation System Created:**
- Established three-tier docs: status.md, technical/, design/
- Created workflows.md for common development tasks
- Streamlined CLAUDE.md from 312→124 lines (navigation only, no duplication)
- Technical docs use topic-based organization (no ADR numbering)

**Project Architecture Defined:**
- Monorepo with 6 libraries in dependency layers: foundation → renderer → ui/world/game-systems → engine
- Headers and implementation side-by-side (not separate include/src dirs)
- Custom ECS in engine (roll our own, not EnTT)
- Philosophy: Build core systems ourselves, only use external libs for platform/formats

**Major Architectural Decision: Vector-Based Assets**
- All game assets are SVG files with dynamic rasterization
- Procedural variation per tile (color, scale, rotation)
- Inter-tile blending for seamless appearance
- Aggressive caching strategy (hybrid: pre-rasterize common + LRU for variants)
- LOD system (16/32/64/128px based on zoom)
- Created comprehensive tech doc: vector-asset-pipeline.md

**C++ Standards Established:**
- Naming: PascalCase classes/functions, camelCase variables, m_ members, k constants
- `#pragma once` for headers (not traditional guards)
- User's clang-format config: tabs, 140 col limit, align declarations
- clang-tidy with naming enforcement + modernization checks
- Manual formatting (Shift+Alt+F), not on-save

**Essential Engine Patterns Documented:**
- String hashing (FNV-1a) - compile-time hash for fast lookups
- Structured logging - categories + levels, debug logs compile out
- Memory arenas - linear allocators for temp data (10-100x faster)
- Resource handles - 32-bit IDs with generation (safe, hot-reload friendly)
- Immediate mode debug draw - simple API for visualization

**UI Testability Strategy:**
- Scene graph JSON export for inspection
- HTTP debug server (debug builds only)
- Visual regression tests (screenshot comparison)
- Inspector overlay (F12 in debug builds)
- Event recording/playback

**World Generation:**
- Pluggable IWorldGenerator interface
- Initial Perlin noise generator (TEMPORARY - marked for replacement)
- Progress reporting during generation
- Integration with 3D preview and 2D sampling

**Game Development Conventions:**
- Use "scene" terminology (SplashScene), not "screen"
- Assets called "SVG files", not "images" or "textures"
- Test UI components in ui-sandbox before using in main game

**Project Structure Created:**
- All library directories with CMakeLists.txt
- VSCode config (launch.json, tasks.json, settings.json)
- .clang-format and .clang-tidy configs
- .gitignore configured
- vcpkg.json with dependencies (including nanosvg for SVG)
- Asset directories: assets/tiles/{terrain,vegetation,structures}
- README.md with full setup instructions

**Next Session Should:**
1. Test that CMake configures properly
2. Implement string hashing system
3. Implement logging system
4. Begin creating actual library implementations
