// Path queries over a built NavMesh: locate the triangle containing a point,
// and find a taut, radius-clamped polyline from start to goal for a disc agent.
//
// EXACT / FLOAT BOUNDARY. Topology is exact via the integer predicates:
// locateTriangle uses orientation(), and the A* corridor only follows the
// mesh's integer adjacency, so reachability (start/goal on-mesh, corridor
// connectivity) is decided entirely by exact arithmetic. The path SHAPE is not:
// A* edge costs and heuristics are doubles (they only order the search), and the
// funnel does its apex/bound math in double, then rounds each emitted corner to
// the nearest millimeter. So whether a path exists is exact; where its bends sit
// is rounded-deterministic. The float work is platform-stable (no transcendental
// functions, fixed evaluation order) and the A* tie-break is by triangle index,
// so a given (mesh, start, goal, radius) yields identical points every run.

	// Per-agent belief overlay on the shared truth mesh (see pathfinding-architecture

	// agent, which blocked faces that agent may cross:
	//   knownSegments == nullptr  -> TRUTH query: knows everything, reproduces v1
	//                                routing exactly (doors pass, solid walls block).
	//   knownSegments != nullptr  -> BELIEF query: a wall segment the agent has not
	//                                seen is treated as ABSENT (path goes straight
	//                                through it); a seen wall blocks unless the agent
	//                                also knows a door through it.
	// A negative faceBlocker is a common-knowledge terrain sentinel (water/tree, or a
	// junction with no incident-wall id) and always blocks, filter or not. A junction
	// tagged with a positive incident-wall segment id is belief-gated like that wall.

	//            diameter). A `false` never hides a real path -- it is sound.
	//   true  => MAYBE reachable. The forest over-approximates (bottleneck is an
	//            upper bound), so the caller must still run pathThrough for certainty.
	//
	// belief.knownSegments == nullptr selects the truth forest (AI goal validity);
	// otherwise the terrain forest, whose disconnect is sound for every belief.
